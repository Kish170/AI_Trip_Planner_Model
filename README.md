# AI Trip Planner Model
## Description
- This is the main portion of my AI Trip Planner project, where I used Python libraries to construct two AI models to power the recommendation system of this project and provide users with a personalized trip itinerary. 
- Incorporated a Gensim Word2Vec model trained on datasets from Kaggle on airline and hotel reviews that is customized to process the relevant information from a user's input
- Developed a miniscular version of the Word2Vec model using TensorFlow's Keras that was trained on a custom dataset I created to analyze and understand synonyms for specific concepts
- Once the full model is complete I plan to intergrate this into a full web application with a booking system for flights and hotels

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Technologies:** Tensorflow, Keras, Gensim, NumPY, Pandas, NLTK, SpaCy

## Features
- **Personalize Itinerary Generation:** Outputs a travel intinerary of flights and hotels, through processing user's input in natural language
- **Data Driven Insights:** Leveraged Kaggle datasets and a custom dataset to train AI models
- **Word-Embedding-based User Input Processing:** Utilized the idea of word embeddings to understand the context of ambigous user input
